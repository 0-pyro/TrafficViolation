## Java Proj

Made this in VSCode, so it comes with some pre-made Java project stuff.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

lib contains the required MySQL JDBC Connector .jar. Maybe I should remove it, but idc. 
Run App.java if you want to test.
